# netnscli
 NetNSCLI is a lightweight Go-based CLI tool, built with Cobra, designed for creating network testbeds effortlessly from YAML configurations. 






## Notes

This project started purely for fun and to find some relief from the summer heat in Sicily. Jokes aside, it was created to tinker with Go and the netlink and netns packages. Additionally, I wanted a more straightforward and structured way to create local testbeds for my experiments, as I was tired of writing bash scripts.
